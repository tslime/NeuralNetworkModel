# Neural Network from Scratch

A minimal deep learning framework built from scratch in Python. Implements core neural network components such as layers, activations, loss functions, and a custom training loop using gradient descent.

## Features

- Forward and backward propagation
- Support for ReLU, sigmoid, and MSE loss
- Manual weight updates with gradient descent
- Loss tracking and training visualization on toy datasets
- Modular structure (easy to extend)

## Tech Stack

Python, NumPy

## How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tslime/NeuralNetworkModel.git
cd NeuralNetworkModel

# Run training script
python3 main.py
